# PacMan2D_UnrealEngine
A simple version of the classic 2D Pac-Man made in UE, as part of an evaluation test of seven days to assess my programming skills. This test was the first step of a job interview for a Junior Game Programmer position. Everything in this repo was produced in roughly 27 hours of work (from 2025/04/18 to 2025/04/23), as shown in the .xlsx and the .docx files.

## Test Instructions and Tasks
The instructions for the test were fairly simple: implement the classic 2D Pac-Man in Unreal Engine using C++ code as much as possible, thereby avoiding the use of blueprints as much as possible. So the entire game logic was implemented with C++ code, while all of the physics and graphical aspects of the game (e.g. map building, characters and fruits placement in the world, etc.) were managed from the Unreal Editor.
