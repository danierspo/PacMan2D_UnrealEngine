# PacMan2D_UnrealEngine
A simple version of the classic 2D Pac-Man made in UE, as part of an evaluation test of seven days to assess my programming skills. This test was the first step of a job interview for a Junior Game Programmer position. Everything in this repo was produced in roughly 27 hours of work (from 2025/04/18 to 2025/04/23), as shown in the .xlsx file.
